Importance of street names
In India, we aren't used to street names so much. We have street names there, but I feel it's not part of our daily conversation the way it works in Dublin. In Dublin, people rely a lot on street names. Whenever they have to talk about a place, they refer to it by its street name. It takes a bit of time, but it's worth starting to refer to places by street names. For example, X restaurant on Y street, and so on.
