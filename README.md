Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Dublin (UCD) are the best ones. <br> There are others such as 
- National College of Ireland (NCI), 
- TU Dublin, 
- Dublin Business School

# Jobs
Most Indians in Dublin work in Tech and nursing. I would be surprised if you visit a tech office and not see an Indian. Similarly, a substantial Indian population of Kerala origin work in nursing.
# Pay
Levels.fyi offers pay reliable pay related information for tech jobs.
# Send money home
There are many ways to send money home but I have been using Aspora for a while. Aspora has been the best so far. It's no advertisement by the way, just my personal experience. Your first transfer is free, and you earn €25 when you send €1000+ total.

# Visa progression

# Part-time
I worked part-time for just 2 weeks at a Cirlce K's Deli. I quickly realized it wasn't for me. I pivoted to teaching part-time during my master's.

But others work part-time at all sorts of places - Circle K, Spar, Lidl, Tesco, Penneys, food delivery, Amazon delivery, Security etc.

There are long journey trains from Heuston station in Dublin, taking you to other cities like Galway.

Cabs are very costly here but you can use the following on emergency or if you have an extra kidney to spare - Dublin Taxi, Uber, Bolt, Freenow.

Importance of street names<br>
In India, we aren't used to street names so much. We have street names there, but I feel it's not part of our daily conversation the way it works in Dublin. In Dublin, people rely a lot on street names. Whenever they have to talk about a place, they refer to it by its street name. It takes a bit of time, but it's worth starting to refer to places by street names. For example, X restaurant is on Y street, and so on.

# Travel
As an Indian citizen on Irish residence permit card, you don't automatically get access to other EU countries or Schengen area. This is a huge disadvantage I feel. You are pretty much landlocked in this country on IRP card. To enter other countries, you need to go through a separate visa process.

- Visa: Schengen, US, UK
- Embassy area
