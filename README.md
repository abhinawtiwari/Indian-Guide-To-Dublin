# About me
I am Abhinaw. I came to Dublin a few years ago. This guide is my effort to help others, especially Indians, with firsthand information and insights about this place.

If you like this guide, you can buy me a coffee at
Revolut: https://revolut.me/abhinaw

You can connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinawtiwari/. Please don't hesitate to DM for paid appointments.

I have also created a video series on YouTube, available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH_4qIEY5Eyh5H4C1fUG6R45jcOTjfRLD
# Good Universities for Master's
Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Dublin (UCD) are the best ones. <br> There are others such as 
- National College of Ireland (NCI), 
- TU Dublin, 
- Dublin Business School
- Griffith College, etc

# Jobs
Most Indians in Dublin work in Tech and nursing. I would be surprised if you visit a tech office and not see an Indian. Similarly, a substantial Indian population of Kerala origin work in nursing.
# Pay
Refer https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/locations/greater-dublin-area for reliable pay related information for tech jobs.
# Send money home
There are many ways to send money home but I have been using Aspora for a while. Aspora has been the best so far. It lets you send money on google rates, which is unprecedented. It's no advertisement by the way, just my personal experience. Your first transfer is free, and you earn €25 when you send €1000+ total.

# Part-time
I worked part-time for just 2 weeks at a Cirlce K's Deli. I quickly realized it wasn't for me. I pivoted to teaching part-time during my master's.

But others work part-time at all sorts of places - Circle K, Spar, Lidl, Tesco, Penneys, food delivery, Amazon delivery, Security etc.
# Commute
Leap card is advisable as soon as you land here. As a student, you get 50% discount on all your commutes using leap card.<br>

More on leap card [here](https://about.leapcard.ie/).

Common modes of commute are Dublin Bus, Luas, Dart, Commuter, Rail <br>

There are long journey trains from Heuston station in Dublin, taking you to other cities like Galway.

You can have a look at the Dublin rail map — DART, Luas and key airport bus routes at https://www.dublinpublictransport.ie/dublin-train-map

Cabs are very costly here but you can use the following on emergency or if you have an extra kidney to spare - Dublin Taxi, Uber, Bolt, Freenow.

## Importance of street names
In India, we aren't used to street names so much. We have street names there, but I feel it's not part of our daily conversation the way it works in Dublin. In Dublin, people rely a lot on street names. Whenever they have to talk about a place, they refer to it by its street name. It takes a bit of time, but it's worth starting to refer to places by street names. For example, X restaurant is on Y street, and so on.

# Travel
As an Indian citizen on Irish residence permit card, you don't automatically get access to other EU countries or Schengen area. This is a huge disadvantage I feel. You are pretty much landlocked in this country on IRP card. To enter other countries, you need to go through a separate visa process.

- e-visa: as an Indian, you can get an e-visa to countries like Morocco.
- Visa: Schengen, US, UK visas need to be applied separately. 

Embassy area: embassies of other countries are very conveniently located around Dublin 2 and 4.
  
# Safety
## Personal safety
Places to avoid or be careful at - Tallaght, Citywest. <br>
Bike theft: bike theft is unfortunate but common here. So, better to be safe than sorry. <br>
Teenage laws: criminal laws for under 18 Irish citizens are usually loose. This is not a legal advice but I would stay away from them.<br>

## Road safety
Ireland has similar road safety rules like India. It's also easier because Ireland also follows the stay on left side rule.

There are bike lanes if you cycle. There are safety standards for bikes too, like lights, high-visibility vests, helmet etc.
# Driving license
If you are habituated to drive two-wheelers in India, Ireland's weather may not be the most suitable for it.

International permit issued from India can help you drive a car here for a year. Beyond that, you need an Irish driving license.
# Geography
Ireland has four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. For meteorological purposes, they are defined as follows: winter (December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and autumn (September to November).
